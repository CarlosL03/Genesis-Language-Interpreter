CS-420, Spring 2024

This was the end of semester project where we were tasked with designing a new functional programming language
designed for any userbase of our choosing and implementing a line-by-line interpreter for executing program
files written in this language. 
I came up with Genesis, a programming language designed for non-technical learners who may be intimidated by
the mathematical symbols and strict grammar of other programming languages. It was inspired by the want to 
be able to teach my family and friends how to code when they may be put off by the strange syntax. I wanted
to create a language that would be easy to write and read by someone who has no experience in coding. I felt
that there were already enough languages for programmers, so I wanted to create a language for non-programmers.
This repository includes an unfinished interpreter and some example programs that are able to be executed by 
the interpreter.
I also created a website to showcase this project here: https://sites.google.com/sdsu.edu/genesis/home
